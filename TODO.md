- [X] Delete posts
- [X] Setup route

## Client
- [X] Split functionality up a bit
- [X] Global blog service so that controllers can be much cleaner
- [ ] Get route set up with related controler rather than in config
- [X] Break down codeHighlight() for Showdown. Separate completely? 
- [X] Pagination
- [ ] Make client tests slightly less mental
# New Posts/Admin
